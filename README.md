# Python-Project

### Develop a Python program that simulates a retail ordering system. The system will allow users to purchase products with volume-based discounts, optionally visit a stationary store with loyalty-based discounts, select delivery or pick-up options, and choose a payment currency. The program should also update inventory quantities and perform currency conversions based on provided exchange rates.
